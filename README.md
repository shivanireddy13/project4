# Why is the Monaco Grand Prix considered boring?

# What is this?

This project explores why Formula One's "crown jewel" race in Monaco has gotten slower and less action-packed throughout the years. By "action", I'm primarily referring to overtaking and displays of race craft. By working on this project, I hope to improve my GGPlot and Adobe Illustrator skills, and do beginner level scrollytelling.

# Data Collection

This project used data from the [Fast F1 API](https://github.com/theOehrly/Fast-F1), [motorsport.com](https://us.motorsport.com/f1/news/how-much-does-an-f1-car-weigh-in-2023/10437686/) and the F1 betting website [Bonus Code Bets](https://talksport.com/sport/motorsport/1118742/monaco-grand-prix-formula-1-lewis-hamilton-pierre-gasly/#:~:text=Research%20conducted%20by%20BonusCodeBets%20shows,other%20circuit%20on%20the%20calendar.)

# Analysis

I charted all races from 2005 to 2022's average fastest lap times to see if there was a trend in overall race speed. I found that races got slower from around 2008 to 2014. In this time period, I found that F1 car weights were steadily increasing. My hypothesis seemed that higher the weight, slower all the races would become, but this was not the case, as races became faster after 2014. 
I also found that as cars got bigger, they became more and more unsuitable for racing in Monaco, a track where road width can be as narrow as seven meters. So if the modern F1 car is 2 meters long, two F1 cars side to side take up a minimum of 4 meter space, leaving very little room for overtaking maneuvers at high speeds. And fewer overtakes mean lesser action. 


# What can I improve?

I want to improve my scrollytelling skills, completely debug my ai2html problems and find a reason for the speed change from 2008 to 2014 that better explains the slower racing.
